# Want to contribute. 

1) Start or join a thread in the Github Issue's that interest's you
2) Create a PR and satisfy the checks
3) Get me (Adam Hammer) to review the PR and merge

I'm going to attempt to create issues as I work/see them within Github.

Any issue filed is an invitation to contribute.
