# dart_board
An extensible flutter-framework

Dart Board allows you to break your app into features and then integration cleanly and consistently. It's essentially a feature loader offering no features but the ability to load and integrate features.

### Why 0.9.x for now

I think the API and basic features are complete for a 1.0 release.

However, until test coverage it won't be marked 1.x. Use at your own risk.

Tests will come soon, or feel free to contribute.
