# dart_board_authentication_google

Firebase authentication delegate/support for firebase.

## Getting Started

Make sure to include Firebase in your app. This does not perform any config.

Follow googles instructions. It varies depending on platform. You will need to edit HTML/Android/iOS files and set things up in the console. This tutorial doesn't really cover that.

dart_board_firebase_core dependency will handle the firebase init for you.

## Usage

Just include it, and place a LoginButton();

Otherwise, standard dart_board_authentication usage for auth updates and user info.
