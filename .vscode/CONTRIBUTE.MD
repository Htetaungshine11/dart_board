Contributions

The following work is up for grabs if you are interested in contributing, 
just reach out to me at [ adamhammer2 (at) gmail dot com ] and I'll do my
best to facilitate finding work.

Features
  - Auth (Firebase/Google)
  - Forms (Migrate QuickForm)
  - Page Templates
  - API Wrappers (when a existing library could be well adapted as a Feature)
  - State Wrappers (e.g. Redux, BloC etc)  

Tests
  - Yes please

Documentation
  - Also, yes please.


Generally reach out, or file an issue. Once direction/goals are set we can start
the PR process. It's pretty informal for now.
