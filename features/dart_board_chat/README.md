# dart_board_chat_feature

Add a super simple Chat feature to your app. This is built on top of `dart_board_firebase_database` and `dart_board_authentication`.

## Getting Started

1) Configure Firebase for your platform (follow googles guides, not included here)
2) Include  DartBoardChatFeature() into your app
3) Navigate to "/chat" to use. 

## Coming Soon

More integrations, e.g. `/chat_channel` that can take a channel ID and drop the selector.
