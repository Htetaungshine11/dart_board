# Add2App

This framework was born out of experience with Add2App, so before release I'll add this amazing functionality.

Many people are interested in flutter, but not interested in learning how to do it from an Add2App style. However it comes with many added benefits.

# Benefits
- Shared code between iOS/Android
- Headless functionality (e.g. repository or service)
- Ability to write cool flutter code
- Allows "rewrite in place".

# Weaknesses
- Nav 1.0 + Flutter has serious limitations (mitigated by nav 2.0)
- RPC Style Coding (mitigated by pigeon)


The goal of this project is to add an Add2App native android->flutter example, integrating the "Example" page in a variety of ways into a standard android application.



## Todo

- Refactor Example into 2 parts.
- Create SpaceX Data Bindings (headless flutter)
- Create SpaceX Linking
- Show additional toggle options (e.g. Go back to native)
-
